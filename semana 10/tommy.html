					<h3>Tommy Hilfiger</h3>

					<p>
						In one of the stranger moments in fashion history, the designer Paco Rabanne, famed for his futuristic dresses made of plastic discs, gave up his career and hightailed it out of Paris in 1999 because he was coßvinced that the Russian space station Mir was about to crash-land and destroy the city during a solar eclipse.
						<br>
						This is a designer, mind you, who also claimed to be an alien from planet Altair—an odd footnote for a man who made such a seismic impact with his mod fashions for the Youthquake generation. The House of Rabanne survived his absence and nearly two decades later is known mostly for blockbuster fragrances. Meanwhile, attempts by other designers to revive the fashion side have had even less impact on Paris than Mir did in the end.
						<br>
						Disco Defiance, we might call it. In Paris, Julien Dossena at Paco Rabanne is one of those young designers who’s leading the unapologetic return to the dance floor (and all the French-girl sexiness that goes along with that). For very good reason: “Since the terrorist attacks in Paris, I have never been out so much. My friends, the same. It’s a way to get your head out of that crap reality,” he said backstage as models were getting zippered into skintight silver chainmail bodysuits and shimmering asymmetric dresses all around him. “But this is not to deny it,” he continued, “It’s to resist it. They target concert halls and gay clubs—where young people are. But you know what? We dress up, and we go out.”
